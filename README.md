## 🚗 Case Study Scenarios

| Case | Traffic Condition | Signal Type         | Outcome Summary                            |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| A    | High traffic       | Adaptive (Optimized) | 35% reduced congestion, highest efficiency |
| B    | Medium traffic     | Fixed               | Moderate traffic flow                       |
| C    | Medium traffic     | Non-optimized       | Long delays, inefficient travel             |

## 🌍 Environmental & Economic Impact

- 🌿 Reduced emissions due to less idle time
- ⏱️ Faster commuting leads to more productivity
- 💰 Potential savings in urban traffic management

---

## 🧠 How A* Algorithm Works

A* combines Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search:

```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
g(n): Actual cost from start to current node
h(n): Heuristic estimated cost from current node to goal
```

Used in the project to simulate smart routing and traffic decision-making.
